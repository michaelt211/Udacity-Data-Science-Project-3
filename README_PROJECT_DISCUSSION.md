Contains Udacity Project 3 for the Data Science Track 

Provide a discussion about the results, as well as a method by which you could test how well your recommendation engine is working in practice: 

This project is a recomendation engine project. The recommendation engine was completed using cosine similarity and recommends articals for users based on similar user preferences. 

The recommendation engine would improve article selection over not using anything. Splitting the data into a test and training set and testing the model using a subset of the data is one way of computing results. In practice running the model and either asking the user how the recommendation engine is performing or if it's a website examining user behavior/whether the user engages with our recommendations would be how I'd test the model.
